# RNA-seq: differential expression analysis

In this session we will be using R to identify differentially expressed
genes in the yeast data set.

We'll use a combination of R markdown output and slides:

 - R markdown: [rnaseq-diffexp.md](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/RNA-seq-workshop/blob/master/4.Differential_Expression/rnaseq-diffexp.md)
 - Slides: [lecture_differential_expression.pdf](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/RNA-seq-workshop/blob/master/4.Differential_Expression/lecture_differential_expression.pdf)
