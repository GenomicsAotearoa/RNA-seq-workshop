# RNA-seq: pathway analysis

In this session we will be using R to perform a pathway analysis based on over-representation 
analysis. 

We'll use a combination of R markdown output and slides:

 - R markdown: [rnaseq-pathway.md](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/RNA-seq-workshop/blob/master/5.Overrepresentation_Analysis/rnaseq-pathway.md)
 - Slides: [lecture_annotation_pathways.pdf](https://github.com/GenomicsAotearoa/RNA-seq-workshop/blob/master/5.Overrepresentation_Analysis/lecture_annotation_pathways.pdf)
