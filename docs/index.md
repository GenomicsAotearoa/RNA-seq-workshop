# **RNA-Seq Data Analysis**
</center>

This RNA-Seq workshop aims to get you started with your own RNA-seq analysis and assumes you are already familiar with the basics of bash and R.

## Content

Before getting started, have a look at the [Supplementary data](./07_supplementary.md) for instructions on how to connect to NeSI Mahuika Jupyter.
