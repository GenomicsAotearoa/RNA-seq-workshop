# Introduction to R for Genomics

### Why use R for genomics?
- R, with its statistical analysis heritage, plotting features, and rich user-contributed packages is one of the best languages for the task of analyzing genomic data.
- High-dimensional genomics datasets are usually suitable to be analyzed with core R packages and functions.
- Bioconductor and CRAN have an array of specialized tools for doing genomics-specific analysis.

### Installing Packages
CRAN packages can be installed using install.packages()

```{r}
# install package called `tidyverse`
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
